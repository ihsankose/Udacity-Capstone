Sparkify Churn Predictions
## Overview
---
On this project, the customer activity data-set, retrieved from an fictional on demand music streaming service "Sparkify", is analyzed to predict customer churn. Sparkify has collected 12GBs of data that how its customers interact with the service, with features such as Upgrade, Downgrade, Like, Dislike, Add Friend, Get Error, Browse Homepage-About-Setting-NextSong and Cancel Account. With all the data, we will analyze if we can predict if a user going to churn.    
Due to its size, its not possible to do the all analysis on the local computer. Instead 1/100 size version of the main data-set is provided to train models on local computer. After the project set up to analyse the "lite" version of data-set, it is going to be deployed on AWS, Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) cluster to analyse the full data-set.
